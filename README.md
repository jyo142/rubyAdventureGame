rubyAdventureGame
=================

Created a text based adventure game script in ruby.  Run the script on the terminal if you have ruby installed and you will
be brought to the main menu which will prompt you to run different commands.  Our game was implemented in the MUPL-land
world.  Type 'play MUPL-land' and enjoy the madness that it entails!! :) If you are stuck and do not know what to do type
'help'
